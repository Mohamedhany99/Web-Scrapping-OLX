These Django Application is is connected with MongoDB database so before running you need to edit settings.py to configure it on your own MongoDB database.
in addition I did not have time to work on completing it the way mentioned in the assigned task so I completed another method.
I created a rest api that can be filtered based on the "category" which is the keyword entered and it will return all the requested data.
the scrapper is joined inside the django application but I prefered to leave a copy that can be ran individualy at the top of the file seperated from the django.
as a bonus also I developed the (CREATE - EDIT(UPDATE) - DELETE - GET) APIs for the items in the database.
we can discuss more about the task in the tech interview would be much better.
